## ❓ FAQ

### General

**Q: Is OmniDaemon free?**
A: Yes! OmniDaemon is open source (MIT license). Enterprise support is available for purchase.

**Q: Which AI frameworks are supported?**
A: All of them! OmniDaemon is framework-agnostic. Use OmniCore Agent, Google ADK, LangChain, CrewAI, or any Python callable.

**Q: Do I need Redis?**
A: Redis is the default backend, but OmniDaemon is pluggable. Kafka, RabbitMQ, and other backends are on the roadmap.

**Q: Can I use OmniDaemon in production?**
A: Absolutely! OmniDaemon is designed for production use with features like DLQ, retries, metrics, and horizontal scaling.

### Technical

**Q: How do I scale OmniDaemon?**
A: Just run more agent runner processes. They automatically load balance via consumer groups.

**Q: How are failures handled?**
A: Automatic retries with exponential backoff. After N retries, messages go to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual review.

**Q: Can I run multiple agents?**
A: Yes! Register multiple agents in one runner, or run multiple runners with different agents.

**Q: How do I monitor agents?**
A: Use `omnidaemon health`, `omnidaemon metrics`, and `omnidaemon bus` commands. Prometheus integration coming soon.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Agent not receiving messages?**
A: Check consumer group with `omnidaemon bus groups --topic your.topic`

**Q: High memory usage?**
A: Reduce `OMNIDAEMON_DEFAULT_MAXLEN` to limit stream size.

**Q: Messages in DLQ?**
A: Check with `omnidaemon bus dlq --topic your.topic` and inspect errors.
